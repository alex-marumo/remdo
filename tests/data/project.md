- ToDo
    - Bugs
        - moving note with children
        - Tab in the middle or at the end of a note doesn't indent
        - Pressing backspace at the beginning of a note of which previous sibling is folded causes the siblings children to be lost
        - moving the first child up (so it becomes parent's sibling's last child)
            - same with the last child down
        - very wired behaviour with url pointing to an not existing note
        - unit tests cause browser to disconnect, fix reconnecting
        - tab/shift tab works correctly only at the very beginning of a note
        - unit tests cause browser to disconnect, fix reconnecting
        - marking node with children as don't should toggle children
        - moving note with children
        - reloading page on data/ change
        - marking notes as checked
        - folding all nodes up to a specific level
        - switch to the latest stable lexical version
    - Features
        - fail all kinds of tests if there is an exception in browser's console
        - Note as a component to auto update using listener
        - Change document without reloading the whole page  
        - Auto save all document whenever server is running
        - create lint test case
        - consider changing rootElement to ul/li instead of adjusting schema in rootTransform
        - fail all kinds of tests if there is an exception in browser's console
        - add a warning about jsdom/querySelectorAll, potentially using rewire
        - checked items are not exported correctly to Markdown
            - same about folded items
        - add a warning about jsdom/querySelectorAll, potentially using rewire
        - marking notes as checked
        - folding all nodes up to a specific level
        - switch to the latest stable lexical version
    - Before production
        - improve tiny-invariant in production
    - Lexical bugs
        - Noted
            - cloning listitem node with includeChildren skips children
            - doubled notes with yjs open:
                -       editor.registerMutationListener(ListItemNode, mutatedNodes => {        editor.update(() => {          return;          for (const [key, mutation] of mutatedNodes) {            console.log(key, mutation);            if (mutation !== "created") {              continue;            }            const node: ListItemNode = $getNodeByKey(key);            if ($isRemdoListItem(node)) {              continue;            }            const p = node =>              console.log(node.getType(), node.getKey(), node.getChildren()[0]);            p(node);            const newNode = node.replace(              new RemdoListItem(node.getValue(), node.getChecked()),              true            );            //const newNode = RemdoListItem.clone(node);            p(newNode);            p(node);            //console.log("transforming list item node", $getNodeByKey(key));          }        });      }),
            - list.toggleChecked() should use getChecked
            - getActiveEditorState() (not available publicly) returns a different state than editor.getEditorState() which can cause problems if someone modifies state in editor.update()
            - Vite and it's HMR cause errorOnKlassMismatch when saving custom's node source file
            - throw Error("error") in update works, but throw "error" is silently eaten
            - Reading or just passing editor state should be enough, re-check in the newer lexical version:
                - editor.update(() => {key = $getNearestNodeFromDOMNode(event.target).getKey();});
            - there is no $isLexicalNode function and there is no way to implement is on your own
